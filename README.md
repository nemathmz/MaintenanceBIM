# MaintenanceBIM
This repository contains the components for integrating a maintenance plan and Failure Mode Effect Criticality Analysis outputs into the BIM-SIM API.

Setup Step:

•	Ensure BIM-SIM is installed and fully operational.

•	Save the relevant folders within the components folder.

•	Update Sidebar.tsx and  ActivityWindow.tsx  to incorporate FMECA outputs.

•	Implement the maintenance strategy coloring functionality in RenderWindow.tsx.

•	Save the Maintenance Plan and FMECA in the public folder in Excel format.

Notes:

•	Example formats for the maintenance plan and FMECA mappings are included in the documents folder. Use these templates to ensure compatibility with the platform.

•	This repository only contains components required for integrating FMECA and maintenance plan functionality. The full platform must be set up separately, and these components should be added as part of the API
